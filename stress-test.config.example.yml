# TACo Stress Test Configuration
#
# Copy this file to stress-test.config.yml and fill in real Discord payloads
# captured from your bot logs.
#
# Usage:
#   npx tsx scripts/stress-test.ts --config=stress-test.config.yml
#   npx tsx scripts/stress-test.ts --config=stress-test.config.yml --mode=sweep
#   pnpm stress-test --config=stress-test.config.yml --mode=sweep

defaults:
  # Execution mode: steady, burst, or sweep
  mode: steady

  # Duration in seconds per rate level (for sweep mode or single runs)
  duration: 60

  # Rates to test in sweep mode (requests per second)
  rates: [0.5, 1, 3, 5, 10]

  # Default rate for single-mode runs
  rate: 1

  # Optional: fixed request count instead of duration
  # requests: 20

# Discord payloads captured from bot logs
# Each payload needs:
#   - timestamp: The x-signature-timestamp header
#   - signature: The x-signature-ed25519 header (hex, without 0x prefix)
#   - recipientUserId: The tip recipient's Discord user ID
#   - bodyJson: The full Discord interaction as a JSON string (single line)
#
# To capture payloads, run the bot and send a /taco execute command.
# Look for the "STRESS TEST PAYLOAD" block in the logs and copy the body JSON.

  - name: "example-tip"
    timestamp: "1234567890"
